      <h2 class="second">Theme</h2>

      <p>UH CS GradCon 2020 is the 1st conference on Computer Science related researches done by graduate students at the University of Houston. The conference is going to be hosted on April 27 at the University of Houston. In the past few years, we have encountered that many types of research have been done in the field of computer science in different labs. 
        <br>In order for students to choose their future Ph.D. dissertation or Master thesis, it is critical for them to become familiar with the researches conducted in different groups. It is also important for graduate students to release the resources that are available to them throughout their study period. Therefore, in order to achieve this goal, we have designed this conference so each student will have the chance to demonstrate state-of-the-art researches that he or she is working on. </p>
