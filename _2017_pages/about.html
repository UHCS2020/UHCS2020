      <h2 class="third">Mission</h2>

      <p>UH CS GradCon is an event for the computer science graduate students at the University of Houston to share their research projects with their peers. The conference covers topics in Computer Science and promotes graduate studies and research in the domains of computer science.</p>

      <h2 class="second">Vision</h2>

      <p>UH CS GradCon is a platform for the computer science graduate students at the University of Houston to sharpen their research, presentation, and paper writing skills. We aim to create a real conference environment to give a sense of publication process. As graduate students, we aim to produce high-quality research, and UH CS GradCon creates a support program for the computer science graduate student to present their work and make improvements in their work before they send their papers out in the wild.
